# 30MFF - Introducing Zoom

Our project was an attempt at recreating one of the generic brand videos we see, but doing this in a parody format and pointing out the product's flaws. We went with the product most used for connectivity in these times - Zoom!

For the website to display the film, I wanted the same kind of ironic tongue-in-cheek humour. I poorly edited marketing content, made annoying pop-ups appear and made our team a very "diverse" set of unintentionally hilarious white people.

I think I had expected the design to be sleeker when I first started out, but it ended up fitting the theme to keep it more clunky. There were a lot of elements and other ideas I had envisioned differently in the wireframe, but I am satisfied with the end product. Mainly because if any random person sees it, they would be able to gauge the seriousness and vibe of the website I was going for immediately (I hope)!
